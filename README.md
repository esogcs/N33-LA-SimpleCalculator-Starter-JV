## Introduction

This project is a simple console-based calculator that accepts user input for two numbers and an arithmetic operator. The calculator then performs the corresponding mathematical operation and displays the result in the console.

## Changes
1. Changed the conversion class to be static.
2. Added functions to check if the user's number and operator is valid.
3. Displayed the result in a string builder format
4. Moved the CalcultatorEngine class to it's own projet to make it a DLL.

### Supported Operations

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
  
## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the console application.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the operator and numbers.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter the first number:
5
Enter the second number:
9
Enter an operator: (+, -, *, /, %)
+
Result: 14
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of the operations you can perform with the calculator:

1. **Addition**  
   Input: `5 + 3`  
   Output: `8`

2. **Subtraction**  
   Input: `10 - 4`  
   Output: `6`

3. **Multiplication**  
   Input: `7 * 2`  
   Output: `14`

4. **Division**  
   Input: `8 / 2`  
   Output: `4`

5. **Modulus**  
   Input: `9 % 4`  
   Output: `1`
